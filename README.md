`clusterTrack.Vis` is the companion package for [`clusterTrack`](https://github.com/xarvian/clusterTrack).

It contains visualization tools, workflows, and exploratory examples built around `clusterTrack` outputs.

Create interactive maps from clustered tracks with `map()`. Each map includes:

- track lines and cluster polygons;
- numbered markers for cluster sites;
- popups with cluster and observation details; and
- a time slider for exploring cluster stop times.

Save maps as HTML with `save_map()`, and create a browsable gallery of saved maps with `site()`.

## Installation


```r
remotes::install_github('xarvian/clusterTrack.Vis')
```

## Interactive maps

```r
library(clusterTrack)
library(clusterTrack.Vis)

data(mini_ruff)
ctdf = as_ctdf(mini_ruff) |> cluster_track()
map(ctdf)
```

`map()` returns a `leaflet` map, so it can be extended with standard `leaflet` tools before saving it. Export one or more maps to HTML with:

```r
out_path = "path/to/maps"
map(ctdf) |> save_map(path = out_path)
```

For a collection of exported maps, `site()` copies a Quarto index template into the output directory. Render the resulting `index.qmd` to create an HTML gallery with thumbnails and links to the maps:

```r
site(out_path)
```

See the [map gallery article](https://xarvian.github.io/clusterTrack.Vis/articles/site.html) for a complete example.
